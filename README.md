MOUNTAIN TOKEN (MNT)
Mountain token was created by a professional alpinst and outdoor enthusiast Marcos Costa.

The goal of this project is to help grow awareness of the Cardano ecosystem and share the growth and benefits with all of those who participate.

With a total supply inspired by the highest mountain in the world. Mt. Everest has an altitude of 8849 meters and so the total supply of MNT Token is 884,900,000.

Be part of the MOUNTAIN movement! It will take us to new heights.
